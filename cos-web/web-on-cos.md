1.  In the Buckets section, click Create bucket to create a new bucket.
1.  Under "Predefined Buckets" select "Quickly get started"
2.  Enter a meaningful name for the bucket and click Next
3.  Upload an index.html file. You might want to take this one: [index.html](index.html)
4.  Skip the "Test your bucket" step and click "View bucket configuration"
